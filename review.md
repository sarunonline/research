# Recommendation

Overall, the manuscript discusses the Samarium oxide doping in the Calcium Copper Titanate ceramics. The work discusses the in-situ XPS and gives a good insight into the variation of the oxidation state with the temperature variation. The electrical properties of the studied samples greatly rely on these in-situ measurements. However, the authors cannot convey the important findings in the present manuscript and hence, it needs major revision. The manuscript may be acceptable only after addressing the following points mentioned below:

# English correction
 - English corrections are necessary at various places. Examples are given below:
    - use of "rose".
    - use of past tense and present tense in the same paragraph.
    - avoid the use of "above-mentioned." Instead, write the exact equation.

# Abstract:

  - Provide the complete form of NTC in the abstract
  - Authors have estimated activation energies using two different methods, but, only one is mentioned in the abstract. ***Need revision***


# Introduction
- Provide the complete form of CN (coordination number)


# Experimental 
## Materials preparation
- Provide the make and model of the ball mill used.
- Provide the purity of ethanol and PVA.
- Initial thickness of the sample having 15 mm diameter to be mentioned.
- The reason for thinning is not mentioned in the experimental section.
- Provide the Make and model of the silver paste used.

## Materials characterization
- Correct the Make of XPS
- Typo in the model of multimeter
- Make of the Impedance spectrometer is not provided

# Result and discussion
- The space group is not written correctly. It is an $$Im 3$$ bar. 
- Figure 1(b) also to be plotted similiar to Fig 1 (a). The 3-D plot does not give the information on the peak shift  on various temperatures and remove fig 1(c) as it gives some idea of pattern shift but, it is not convincing and also is a redundent plot.
- Provide the crystallographic parameters obtained for all the samples from the rietveld refinement, including, unit cell parameter (a), and other refinement parameters, namely, occupancy, atomic co-ordinates, etc., available in the final CIF file of the the rietveld refined XRD patterns.
- The DFT results are not substantiated with the experimental results. No characterization on confirming the experimental band gap is available in the manuscript. Comparision of estimated and experimental band gap is required. Also, mention the nature of band gap obtained in the DFT calculation which is missing now.
- The reason for reduced band gap of Sm samples are also not discussed. Need revision.
- The reason for the grain size increase is speculated as the rise in oxygen vacancies. The authors claims that the mass transfer rate is enhancing because increase in Cu and Ti ions. But, Cu and Ti are already present in parent molecule and the level of oxygen vacancies will also remains same. Need revision.
-  The melting point of Sm2O3 is 2335 degree C and that of CCTO is 1975 degree C. In this case, how the solute drag effect is prevalent in excessive Sm2O3 added samples. Need revision.
- The mechanism of the formation of Ca and Cu enriched phases in the ceramics is needed for completeness of the discussion. Need revision.
- Doping of Sm+3 in place of Ca+2 is considered as hole doping, i.e., replacing a divalent ion with a trivalent ion brings an additional hole. The notation of positive Sm ion at the Ca site is correct. But, how the electron charge is coming. The positive charge of Sm must be balanced by the Oxygen ion. Hence, the Kröger–Vink equation must be revisited. Subsequently, the discussion may need revision.
- Write the terms of equation 2 in the manuscript after the text. (Example: where, B25/75 is thermal constant, rho_25 and rho_75 is dc electrical resistivities at 25 and 75 degree C, etc.)
-The XPS baseline correction for oxygen was not performed properly, especially, for x = 0.03 and x = 0.05 sample (Fig 5(c)).
-The discussion of the satallite peak observed in XPS for Cu is not available. Need revision.
- It is not clear for which sample the in-situ XPS measurement was performed. Need revision.
- It is suggested to split the figure 5 into two. One with variation of x and another for the in-situ XPS measurement and hence modify the manuscript appropriately. 
- How the Maxwell-Wagner polarization is confirmed by comparing the Rg and Rgb values? Need further discussion.
- In the Impedance analysis, the space charge polarization is mentioned in the region I. But, in the Nyquist fitting, this was not considered while fitting, considering the fact that the MW polarization and thermal activation is related to the grain and grain boundary dynamics. Suggest revision of Nyquist fitting for space charge polarization at low frequencies.
- Use any one jargon, either, "Nyquist" or "Cole-Cole". There is slight difference between the two terminology. Need correction.
- There is a large difference in the activation energies obtained from conductivity and relaxation (since, both occurs due to similar mechanism), evenif the trend remains the same. Need to be discussed.
- The discussion on the conduction mechanism as the short-range motion of charge carriers based on the difference in peak frequencies is not described in the manuscript. Needs revision.

- Data Availability: It is mentioned that "No data were used for the research described in the article.". The meaning is not clear. It should be something like "The raw Data used in the present research work will be made available on request to authors." Need Correction.
