# Recommendation

Overall, the manuscript discusses the Samarium oxide doping in the Calcium Copper Titanate ceramics. The work discusses the in-situ XPS and gives a good insight into the variation of the oxidation state with the temperature variation. The electrical properties of the studied samples greatly rely on these in-situ measurements. However, the authors cannot convey the important findings in the present manuscript and hence, it needs major revision. The manuscript may be acceptable only after addressing the following points mentioned below:

# English correction
 - English corrections are necessary at various places. Examples are given below:
    - use of "rose".
    - use of past tense and present tense in the same paragraph.
    - avoid the use of "above-mentioned." Instead, write the exact equation.

# Abstract:

  - Provide the complete form of NTC in the abstract
  - Authors have estimated activation energies using two different methods, but, only one is mentioned in the abstract. ***Need revision***


# Introduction
- Provide the complete form of CN (coordination number)


# Experimental 
## Materials preparation
- Provide the make and model of the ball mill used.
- Provide the purity of ethanol and PVA.
- Initial thickness of the sample having 15 mm diameter to be mentioned.
- The reason for thinning is not mentioned in the experimental section.
- Provide the Make and model of the silver paste used.

## Materials characterization
- Correct the Make of XPS
- Typo in the model of multimeter
- Make of the Impedance spectrometer is not provided

# Result and discussion
- The space group is not written correctly. It is an $$Im\overline{3}$$ bar. ***Needs correction***.
- Figure 1(b) is also to be plotted similarly to Fig 1 (a). The 3-D plot does not give information on the peak shift at various temperatures and removes Fig 1(c) as it provides some idea of pattern shift, but it is not convincing and also is a redundant plot. ***Needs revision***.
- Provide the crystallographic parameters obtained for all the samples from the rietveld refinement, including, unit cell parameter (a), and other refinement parameters, namely, occupancy, atomic co-ordinates, etc., available in the final CIF file of the the rietveld refined XRD patterns. ***Needs revision***.
- The DFT results are not substantiated by the experimental results. No characterization confirming the experimental band gap is available in the manuscript. A comparison of the estimated and experimental band gaps is required. Also, mention the nature of the band gap obtained in the DFT calculation, which is missing now. ***Needs revision***.
- The reason for the reduced band gap of Sm samples is also not discussed. ***Needs revision***.
- The grain size increase is speculated as the rise in oxygen vacancies. The authors claim that the mass transfer rate is enhanced because of the increase in Cu and Ti ions. But Cu and Ti are already present in the parent molecule, and the level of oxygen vacancies will also remain the same. ***Needs revision***.
-  The melting point of Sm2O3 is 2335 degrees C, and that of CCTO is 1975 degrees C. In this case, how the solute drag effect is prevalent in excessive Sm2O3 added samples. ***Needs revision***.
- The mechanism of the formation of Ca and Cu enriched phases in the ceramics is needed for the discussion to be complete. ***Needs revision***.
- Doping of Sm+3 in place of Ca+2 is considered as hole doping, i.e., replacing a divalent ion with a trivalent ion brings an additional hole. The notation of positive Sm ion at the Ca site is correct. But how the electron charge is coming? The Oxygen ion must balance the positive charge of Sm. Hence, the Kröger–Vink equation must be revisited. Subsequently, the discussion may need revision.
- Write the terms of equation 2 in the manuscript after the text. (Example: where B25/75 is thermal constant, $$rho_{25}$$ and &&rho_{75}&& are dc electrical resistivities at 25 and 75 degrees C, etc.)
-The XPS baseline correction for oxygen was not performed correctly, especially for the x = 0.03 and x = 0.05 samples (Fig 5(c)). ***Needs revision***.
-The discussion of the satellite peak observed in XPS for Cu is not available. ***Needs revision***.
- It is unclear for which sample the in-situ XPS measurement was performed. ***Needs revision***.
- It is suggested that Figure 5 be split into two. One with the variation of x and another for the in-situ XPS measurement and hence modify the manuscript appropriately. ***Needs revision***.
- How is the Maxwell-Wagner polarization confirmed by comparing the Rg and Rgb values? ***Needs further discussion***.
- In the Impedance analysis, the space charge polarization is mentioned in the region I. However, in the Nyquist fitting, this was not considered while fitting, because the MW polarization and thermal activation are related to the grain and grain boundary dynamics. Revising the Nyquist fitting for space charge polarization at low frequencies is suggested. ***Needs revision***.
- Use any particular jargon, not both. Either "**Nyquist**" or "**Cole-Cole**". There is a slight difference between the two terminology. ***Needs revision***.
- There is a large difference in the activation energies obtained from conductivity and relaxation (since both occur due to similar mechanisms), even if the trend remains the same. ***This needs to be discussed***.
- The manuscript does not describe the discussion on the conduction mechanism as the short-range motion of charge carriers based on the difference in peak frequencies. ***Needs revision***.

# Data Availability: 
- It is mentioned that "No data were used for the research described in the article.". The meaning is not clear. It should be something like "The raw data used in the present research work will be made available on request to authors." ***It needs correction***.
