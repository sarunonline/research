The thermal constant (B) is an important factor in determining the usage range of NTC thermistors which can be obtained by ceramics:

$$ B_{\frac{t_1}{t_2}} = \frac{ln \left(\frac{\rho_{t_1}}{\rho_{t_2}}\right)}{\left[\left(\frac{1}{T_{t_1}}\right) - \left(\frac{1}{T_{t_2}}\right)\right]} $$

where, $`B`$ is the thermal constant, $`t_1`$ is the lower temperature, $`t_1`$ is the higher temperature. $`\rho_{t_1}`$ and $`\rho_{t_2}`$ is the resistivities at $`t_1`$ and $`t_1`$, respectively, and $`T`$ is the temperature of assessment.

The B values above 4000 K meet the requirements for
commercial NTC thermistors, which have a high degree of controllability and can be adjusted to the 
desired values by controlling the dopant concentration.
